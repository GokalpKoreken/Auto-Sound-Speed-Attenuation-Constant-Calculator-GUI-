# Auto-Sound-Speed-Attenuation-Constant-Calculator-GUI-
This programs aim is to ease the calculating Sound-Speed-Attenuation properties of the material that been aplied sound wave and been collected from the hydrophone.
This program plots Time-Voltage excel data that been captured, after the plotting the ΔY adn ΔX values can be insterted on Entry sections 
on GUI by only clicking on the desired sections.

For ΔY, the start and end point of the desired peak is selected, followed by the start and end point of the peak to be differentiated.
And as a result of 4 selections, one ΔY value is inserted into the entry point. (Total 10 ΔY values can be calculated)
For ΔX, just click on two different desired peaks and the ΔX value will be inserted. (Total 10 ΔX values can be calculated)
